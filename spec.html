<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Create a program to index the words in a book.</p>

<h2>Chapters, Paragraphs, Lines, and Words</h2>

<p>For this program, a book is a text input file consisting of chapters, 
paragraphs, lines and words.</p> 

<p>A word is a set of letters and symbols which contains no 
whitespace. For the purposes of indexing, case does not matter. Punctuation 
marks at the end or beginning of a word must be removed. Punctuation marks to 
be removed are: <tt>. ? ! , ; : - " ' _ ( )</tt>.</p>

<p>A line of words consists of words separated by any whitespace except a newline.</p>

<p>A paragraph is a series of lines with no intervening blank lines. A blank 
line is one without a word on it.</p>

<p>A chapter consists of a series of paragraphs prefixed by a paragraph 
containing one line which contains exactly two words. The first word will be 
"chapter" and the second will the number of the chapter, which could be either 
in arabic or roman numerals, as shown below. This line is not part of the 
chapter and should not be indexed.</p>

<pre class="file">CHAPTER 3
Chapter IV
</pre>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>Your program should produce an alphabetical listing of words and 
occurrences of each within the book in the format illustrated below.</p>

<pre class="file">apple 3:P4L3, 3:P5L7, 2:P1L12, 9:P5L5

bakery 4:P5L13

manitoba 8:P11L9, IV:P4L1
</pre>

<p>Each output line consists of the word and comma separated list of 
occurrences. Each occurrence is formatted as: chapter-number, colon, P, 
paragraph-number, L, and line-number. 

</p><h2>Sorting</h2>

<p>Words should be ordered alphabetically. Occurrences should be ordered first 
by chapter appearance order, than by paragraph, and finally by line number. 
However, the publishers believe that the chapter(s) in which a word appears 
the most number of times must be the most important occurrences of the words 
and therefore occurrences in those chapters must appear first in the list. 
Also, only the first occurrences of a word within the same paragraph should be 
listed.</p>

<h2>Special Cases</h2>

<p>A second input file will contain a list of words, one per line, which 
should be completely ignored. For example, the follow might be used.

</p><pre class="file">is
the
of
and
</pre>

<p>A third input file will contain words which should be considered synonyms. 
Each synonym group will appear together on one line of the file. Occurrences 
of any synonym should be considered an occurrence of the first word in each 
synonym group. For example, the following might be given, so wherever light 
occurs it should be treated as bright.</p>

<pre class="file">bright light sunny
main central
begin start first
</pre>

<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>Once your program is built, run it using the example command shown below.</p>

<pre class="cmd">index book.txt ignore.txt synonyms.txt &gt; result.txt
</pre>
